// Create a number variable called pi, assign it the value of pi to as many
// decimal places as you know, then output it. Then, look up the value of pi on
// the internet, and reassign it to the pi variable with at least 50 decimal
// places. Finally, print it out again. Does the program print out all of the
// digits that you assigned to the variable pi?
