// Create one variable of each fundamental type (integer, number, text, and
// boolean). Name them whatever you'd like, and assign them whatever values
// you'd like. Then, experiment with using the output and say commands to
// print or speak the contents of the variables. Finally, assign them all
// different values, and see how the variables have changed if you print or say
// them again.
